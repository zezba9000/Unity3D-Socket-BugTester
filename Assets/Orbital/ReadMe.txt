* This is simply a framework I've made that simplifies async TCP sockets using C# socket APIs in this case.
* NOTE: This API works perfect on native runtimes (outside Unity3D) like .NET 8, Mono, Win, Mac or Lin. (so again, to be very clear, these bugs ONLY happens under Unity3D runtimes or libraries)
* I have simply copied the files in this bug report for simplicity: https://github.com/reignstudios/Orbital-Framework
